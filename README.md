## Description

### Introduction

Pack Fixer is a simple mod that fixes an issue with the Mystic Mesa modpack for Minecraft 1.7.10. During the update process some time ago there was a mod that was removed that had world generation. To stop this from causing an issue, I created a mod that added the block back in (just the block itself - not the world generation).

## Release Notes

Release Notes (or changelogs) for Pack Fixer are available under the [files tab](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pack-fixer/files) on CurseForge.
